## The idea

The idea for this game was based on the chapter in Nick Morgan's book "JavaScrypt for Kids". There the author proposes to write a game using allert.
I wanted to **improve** it and I think I will add new features and updates over time.

## Get start

If you want to copy the project and run it on your computer, follow these steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luchiweb/hungman.git
```

```bash
npm install --save-dev
```

## The technologies used

CSS, HTML, TypeScript (The game itself in the code is a class like Singletone)

## Specifics

For now the game only supports the Russian language, but other languages will be added in the future
